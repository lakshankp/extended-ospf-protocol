# Extended OSPF Protocol

## Identified Issues in Standard OSPF

Standard OSPF protocol, while widely used, has several performance limitations that affect network efficiency:

- **Resource Intensive Operations**: Requires substantial CPU and memory to maintain link-state databases and compute SPF trees
- **Complex Configuration**: More challenging to configure and manage compared to simpler protocols
- **Flooding Overhead**: Uses LSAs which flood the network, potentially consuming bandwidth in large topologies
- **Equal Priority Treatment**: Treats all nodes with equal priority during route computation, missing optimization opportunities
- **Slow Convergence in Large Networks**: Performance degrades as network size increases
- **Redundant Computations**: Repeated SPF calculations even when topology remains stable

## What is Our Solution?

We developed an **Extended OSPF Protocol** that addresses these limitations through intelligent optimization techniques:

### Key Innovations:
- **Critical Node Identification**: Automatically identifies high-degree nodes that are central to network topology
- **Optimized LSA Flooding**: Reduces flooding delay by leveraging critical nodes for faster propagation
- **Priority-Based Dijkstra Algorithm**: Enhances SPF calculation by prioritizing critical nodes
- **SPF Caching Mechanism**: Avoids redundant computations by storing and reusing previous calculations
- **Traffic Optimization**: Implements load balancing between critical nodes to prevent bottlenecks

## How It Works?

### 1. Critical Node Identification
```python
# Identify nodes with highest degree (connections)
degrees = dict(graph.degree())
sorted_nodes = sorted(degrees.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
critical_nodes = top_nodes_or_10_percent(sorted_nodes)
```

### 2. Optimized LSA Flooding
- **With Critical Nodes**: Uses fixed small delay (0.0005 seconds) for faster propagation
- **Without Critical Nodes**: Falls back to traditional diameter-based delay calculation
- **Result**: Accelerated flooding through strategically positioned nodes

### 3. Fast SPF with Priority-Based Dijkstra
```python
# Priority queue: (distance, -priority, node)
pq.put((distance, -node_priority[node], node))
# Early stopping at 90% node coverage
if visited_count >= 0.9 * total_nodes:
    break
```

### 4. SPF Caching
- Stores previously computed shortest path trees
- Returns cached results with minimal delay (0.00001 seconds)
- Eliminates redundant calculations in stable networks

### 5. Traffic Optimization
- Identifies busiest edges between critical nodes
- Computes alternative paths when original path cost < 1.2x alternative
- Balances load distribution across the network
